# Notification Feature Story

As a user, I want to be able to receive in-app and push notifications for different actions taken within Sentinel. Notifications need to be configurable (for example, choosing exactly what notifications I receive), opt in (no push notifications until I accept and configurable).

## Notification Types

There are two main types of notifications

1. Invitation Notifications

We have an invite feature that allows users to be invited to join dashboards. When a user is invited, we want them to receive a notification that allows them to accept or decline the invite without leaving the application.

2. Log Notifications

Within organizations and meetings, we have activity logs that contain different log types. We want the user to be able to configure notifications - either at an organization level (which will also include all its meetings), or at a meeting level.
